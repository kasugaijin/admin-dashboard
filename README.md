# admin-dashboard
This typical user dashboard was built using vanilla CSS grid and flexbox and was great practice using the two powerful tools together. No CSS framework was used herein. The dashbord has three main components:
- a header with a search bar, user greeting, and user buttons/icons;
- a side panel of links; and, 
- a main 'card' area that is divided into two - one section shows a card for each project and the other cards for announcements and trending users.
